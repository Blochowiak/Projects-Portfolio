Among the wildlife at a state park, a population of 100 cranes has been decreasing by 3.24 percent annually. In order to keep the crane population from dissolving,
along with maintaining the revenue from visitors who enjoy the crane sightings, it is paramount that the park manager grow and release approximately eight chicks
per year â€“ the limit their resources will allow. Additionally, the carrying capacity of the park is 200 cranes. Two things will be investigated:

  1. How quickly can a population of 200 cranes be reached?
  2. What will it take for such a population to be maintained?
