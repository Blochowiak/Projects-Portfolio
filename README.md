# School Project - XYZ Cafe
## Advanced Mathematical Modeling
This is a project I made with two other students over a period of about eight weeks. The description of the project can be read in the Executive Summary
or in the Introduction of the Technical Report (both are in this repository).

### Tasks
1. Replicate a lunch rush of business based upon three weeks of prior data.
2. Modify the replication model to include an extra cashier.
3. Modify the replication model to allow for a floating barista who can act as a second cashier when not creating specialty drinks.
4. Perform a cost-benefit analysis on the three models to discern which is best. 

### Methods and Tools Used
* Descriptive Statistics
  - Performed in Excel, from mean/median/mode to correlations between continuous and dichotomous variables.
* Random variables
  - Simulated new data with random variables.
* Distributions
  - Exponential and uniform distributions were utilized to simulate new data.
* C# Programming
  - 10,000 simulations of each model were run using C#.
